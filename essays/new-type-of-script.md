As I make my way through my ICS undergrad degree, I've experienced a great deal of challenging courses and assignments, but as far as we are into ICS 314, I can confidently say I enjoy it. Of course, the earlier weeks of a course aren't always the best judgement of how the remainder of the class will turn out but I haven't been scared away yet. In fact, I've had a very pleasant first impression with ICS 314.


## Athleticism in ICS

ICS 314 introduced me to "Athletic Software Engineering" which I had never quite experienced before. My participation in our per-class coding exercises has revealed a lot about my capabilities as a Software Engineer. 

Regarding the style in general, I appreciate doing solo practice problems! It's something I never really had the chance to do in lower level classes. I feel that in previous courses either a lot of hand-holding or not enough guidance caused my skills to vary. 

But the WOD exercises in 314 help me assess how much I can do on my own and what routes I decide to take when writing a function body. Often times, what I write fulfills the expected output but differs from the examples shown. But that's the beauty of software engineering, isn't it?

## Transitioning to TypeScript

So far I am enjoying TypeScript. The 100+ JavaScript modules we did were also enjoyable and learning that everything I wrote in JavaScript would be applicable to TypeScript was a huge relief. 

What I like most about TypeScript is the platform we code on. I think the TypeScript Playground is so easily accessible and requires no organization. With programs, we have to create, manage, and organize files and I ran into a lot of issues in just that portion of completing homework, but having the TypeScript Playground makes turning in assignments that much easier.

## WODs are Useful!

I truly do think the use of WODs in class are an amazing opportunity to gauge your abilities. And though I've only done a few so far, I can say that they're always pleasant. It measures your logic, your time management, and is a good display of how you problem solve. As mentioned above, my functions never quite match up with the demonstration video afterward, but what the video does provide me with is a new perspective on coding.

With infinite ways to code one thing, I learn more about what a single language can accomplish. As for TypeScript, having spent a year using Java, the transition from Java to JavaScript was not terrible and neither was JavaScript to TypeScript. I'm excited to analyze all of these languages even further.

## Learning Like This

I previously discussed never having experienced a learning style of this type before, and now I wonder why it took so long to get here! Having taken a few asynchronous ICS courses, I never really experienced this type of interactive learning.

I've always preferred hands-on learning in the classroom because you're surrounded by a support system. Your peers are tackling the same problem alongside you and you get a chance to pick their brain. In Computer Science, there's never one single correct way to do something, so when a classmate offers a new perspective on how to get from Point A to Point B it really sticks with me. Further down the line, I can recall how my peers might take on this task if I hit a roadblock.

When learning is done in class, you're also present with the instructor. If your entire group of peers is stuck on a problem, immediate help can be found in the professor, which I find much less daunting that the skewed communication of emails. After you solve a problem in class, having the professor go over the problem and explain their process is great study material that you can't always find in a textbook or through a link.

## In summation...

I think this learning style will both challenge me and enrich my programming skills. We have practice WODs at home and in class and either way they're delivered, they're enjoyed. What's most important to me when it comes to work is the feedback I receive and the help I get along the way which are both fortunately provided through this style of learning.

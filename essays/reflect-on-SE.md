I am now reaching the end of my Spring 2025 semester at UH Manoa. Having taken many classes in my time at this institution, I can say that my Software Engineering course was among the more interesting courses. 

Starting in computer science from the lower levels felt more challenging as everything we learned was completely new to me. But all that I've learned in preceeding classes has cumulated to help me gain a better understanding of ICS 314. There were lessons that were familiar to material learned in ICS 111, 211, and 212, and there were lessons that were 100% new material to me. But through it all, I can say I have a more firm grasp of Software Engineering now at the end of the semester.

## Agile Project Management

One of the things that stuck with me the most throughout ICS 314, possibly because it happened most recently, was Agile Project Management (AGM). The style of AGM we learned in ICS 314 was called Issue Driven Project Management, which we executed through GitHub. 

This was not my first time experiencing group project delegation via GitHub. I attended KCC for my ICS 211 class where we also completed a group project through GitHub, but the way we managed our individual tasks for our final 314 project was different, and in my opinion, more efficient. Issue Driven Project Management had us break our project down into smaller issues that we could assign to ourselves or others. We could track the status of our issues and break our project down into 3 separate milestones. It was a lot easier to manage than it was in 211 and did help us stay on track.
  
## Learning Through AI 

I really had only begun to use AI in college as a sounding board for my ideas. But with some professors allowing it's use, and others even encouraging it, I began to see it for all its worth. While it can be seen as a cheat code for a quick A, there are many things I have taken away from studying with AI. 

If I ask a question to an AI chatbot and it answers correctly, there's a high chance I would remember the interaction and not need to use it again for similar issues. There certainly may be people out there who use it at every opportunity, but I think it's good to use it when needed, and avoid using it if you can. AI can also bring more challenges than help as it tends to over complicate a simple answer if you don't know how to properly describe it. 

## Future Considerations

AI is only expanding and may soon be able to provide quicker, more detailed answers. As this power comes, a lot more academic responsibility will need to be exercised. While it is a good way to study or learn, I would say to use as many of the class-provided materials to study before touching AI. Of course, I do see myself using AI in the future, but not without careful consideration of what I am asking it to help me with and not without really measuring the necessity of its assistance.

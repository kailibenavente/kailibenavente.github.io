The conversation of AI usage in academic settings has always been rocky institution wide. There are some gray areas, though, when the conversation comes to those studying computer science. And while the use of AI for assistance with assignments was allowed during my taking of ICS 314, I would make efforts to solve the issues without having to rely on tools like ChatGPT or Co-Pilot.


## My Usage

There is a certain air around the use of AI in computer science classes. Yes, it is a tool that some ICS students may work with when learning about the function of or trying to build AI, but the use of it to assist with things you should be able to study on your own may be harder to justify. Because of these gray areas, I made an effort to keep the use of it to a minimum.

AI usage was permitted during class in many different areas.

I never found the use of AI necessary when working on Experience WODs, or our homework WODs, because of the example video. If I was confused, iwould watch the explanation on it without feeling the need to use AI for help.
I did find myself using AI for In-class Practice WODs. I would go about the WOD in whichever way I thought was correct, and when errors came up I would use AI to help point out where I might've went wrong on my code.
In-class WODs were often very similar to the practice, so I tried not to use AI and instead tried to remember what I learned in the previous class.
Essays never really required AI from me, they were always my thoughts surrounding whatever topic we were writing about.
Our Final project lasted a while and came with some very unique problems. And the more specific our issues got, the more we would have to use AI for help on less general issues.
When it came to Learning a concept / tutorial, I could usually rely on a youtube video for that. If it's a new concept we're learning that already exists somewhere, I could either use the provided video lectures, or a tutorial online.
Answering a question in class or in Discord never required AI for me to handle, and neither did asking or answering a smart-question.
As for Coding examples, I never really asked for them, but I would usually ask for help explaining code and writing code.
I would say I didn't use AI for documenting code, as I didn't see it as necessary.
I constantly would check for quality assurance in my code with AI because I didn't want any unnecessary lines that could be written more efficiently in my projects.
And for anything else not mentioned, I can say I didn't use AI.
  
## Learning Through AI 

I really had only begun to use AI in college as a sounding board for my ideas. But with some professors allowing it's use, and others even encouraging it, I began to see it for all its worth. While it can be seen as a cheat code for a quick A, there are many things I have taken away from studying with AI. 

If I ask a question to an AI chatbot and it answers correctly, there's a high chance I would remember the interaction and not need to use it again for similar issues. There certainly may be people out there who use it at every opportunity, but I think it's good to use it when needed, and avoid using it if you can. AI can also bring more challenges than help as it tends to over complicate a simple answer if you don't know how to properly describe it. 

## Future Considerations

AI is only expanding and may soon be able to provide quicker, more detailed answers. As this power comes, a lot more academic responsibility will need to be exercised. While it is a good way to study or learn, I would say to use as many of the class-provided materials to study before touching AI. Of course, I do see myself using AI in the future, but not without careful consideration of what I am asking it to help me with and not without really measuring the necessity of its assistance.

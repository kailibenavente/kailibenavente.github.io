This program was another interactive assignment we had in ICS 212 also written in C. The user can type as many characters as they want, or input a file through the command line, and the program will return the amount of letters used in the passage and the total characters typed.

Here is a sample a run:

NARRATOR:     
(Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
According to all known laws
of aviation,
 :
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
 :
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
 :
The bee, of course, flies anyway
 :
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
BARRY BENSON:
(Barry is picking out a shirt)
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
 :
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
JANET BENSON:
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
BARRY:
Coming!
 :
Hang on a second.
(Barry uses his antenna like a phone)
 :
Hello?
